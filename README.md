# Udacity-CS334
For CUDA leaner

# Build in Linux
My envrioment is Ubuntu 18.04 with g++6 and Clion(2019.1)
I recommend for you to use Clion (version > 2019.1) with plugin 'CLionm CUDA Run patcher'.
If you have installed everything correctly, you can run the project easily on Clion.

I have changed something in CMakeLists, then you can use it easily in other IDE.
