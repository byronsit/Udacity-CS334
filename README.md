# Udacity-CS334
For CUDA leaner

# Build in Linux
My envrioment is Ubuntu 18.04 with g++6 and Clion(2019.1)
I recommend for you to use Clion (version > 2019.1) with plugin 'CLionm CUDA Run patcher'.
If you have installed everything correctly, you can run the project easily on Clion.

I have changed something in CMakeLists, then you can use it easily in other IDE.


# Problem Set 1
you should set your configurions in your clion, which you can click the "run" and find it.
put in this
"/home/bohuan/code/CUDA-CS344/Problem Sets/Problem Set 1/cinque_terre_small.jpg"  a.png target.png
and run the code
